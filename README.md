# classicalSims

This repository is for classically simulation current phase relations (CPRs) of common circuits.
In particular, this application is meant to be interfaced through the scr/main.py function to
simulate all varieties of "leg" circuits (a JJ in series with a inductor)

- Can be programatically interfaced with via command line arguments or YAML config files.
